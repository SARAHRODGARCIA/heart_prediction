# heart_prediction ðŸ’š
Predictive model for cardiovascular disease using real patient data. Features include age, gender, height, weight, glucose levels, smoking, alcohol intake, and physical activity. The model helps identify patients at risk and supports early intervention.

Objective

The main goal is to predict the probability of a patient having cardiovascular disease based on their clinical characteristics and lifestyle habits using Machine Learning techniques.

Possible Applications

Assisting healthcare professionals in the early detection of cardiovascular diseases

Screening tools for clinics and hospitals

Research on risk factors related to cardiovascular diseases

Next Steps

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): to understand patterns and distributions

Preprocessing: cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalization

Model Training: Logistic Regression,

Model Evaluation: using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve

Deployment: creating a pipeline for predictions on new patients.
